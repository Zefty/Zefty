### About Me

Hi, I’m Jaime, a full-stack developer based in Auckland, New Zealand — eyeing the classic Kiwi move across the Tasman.

I’ve worked across fintech and startups, with professional experience in C#/.NET and AWS. These days, I’m focused on DevOps and developer tooling at Kiwibank.

I keep my skills sharp through side projects using modern web technologies like Next.js and TypeScript.
